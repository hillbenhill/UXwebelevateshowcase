Hi I’m Ben Hill from Team 37. I am a coder and I joined the Haven project in Mid-April. Although team 37’s VR concept was abandoned . The key skills learned from online collaboration enabled us to integrate with the new team seamlessly. Having produced a requirements specification for our previous product, i was able to understand the key aspects of Haven
As with Nora, I arrived late into the Haven project, but was soon able to utilise my learnings from the coding to start contributing to the project.

Hi I’m Nora McGillicuddy from Team 37. I am a PM and I joined the Haven Project in Mid-April
As a latecomer to the Haven project I had to hit the ground running to fully understand the concept. Following this, I was immediately able to contribute to establishing a release plan using the Agile methodology. 
(screenshot of release plan?)

Hi, I’m Sanja Trinki formerly of Team 29, I live in Donegal and I am a designer for the Haven project
Working closely with the team, I have attempted to take the original vision of Haven and develop it into a meaningful and functional application.
Haven has numerous possible functions. So deciding on what should be within our scope for this project was absolutely critical in what could be deemed to be a minimum viable product.

By using the agreed upon personas together with our research results, I feel I was able to define the requirements necessary to bring Haven to this stage, where it could be released as a product that meets the basic demand for our vision. 

(Screenshot of relevant Req Spec stuff??)
I have been involved in all of the design work relevant deliverables for this project, from the various landing pages required for the Marketing Strategy, through to the composition of the showcase website and product video.

Hi, I’m Paddy McGlinchey formerly of Team 29. I live in Donegal and I am a PM on the Haven project.
When the brief for the Minor Project was released, we as a team carefully examined each of the three themes
Using Coggle to brainstorm our thoughts and ideas, it was soon obvious that collectively we wanted to develop a product that could really make a difference to somebody’s life!
(Screenshot of Coggle brainstorm session??)

The connected home theme became the most obvious route for us to fulfil this goal. 
And we felt that rather than use this theme to just simplify people’s normal daily chores, why not explore 
ways within smart technology to enable the vulnerable in our society stay safe and live independently within their 
home for as long as possible! It was a subject that we could all feel a certain amount of empathy towards, and from that, 
the Haven home care application was born!

As a PM on Haven, I have been involved in most aspects of the project cycle, from the project management to 
the marketing strategy (needs rewording!!!)

<p>With the rapid population ageing that is occurring world-wide, there is increasing interest in “smart home” technologies 
that can assist older adults to continue living at home with safety and independence.</p>

<p>Improved health and social care over recent years has increased life expectancy worldwide. As a result, in 2010 an 
estimated 524 million people were aged 65 or older - 8% of the world’s. By 2050, this number is expected to nearly 
triple to about 1.5 billion, representing 16% of the world’s population.</p>


<p>The current trends in population demographics make it increasingly difficult for governments worldwide to 
fully support the health and social care systems. Therefore, a large proportion of older adults rely solely on family 
members for assisted care, often resulting in great emotional stress for family caregivers.</P>

<p>As Diane Cook, lead researcher of Washington State University’s “Smart Home Projects” describes, “Individuals don’t want to 
leave their home even if they live in a rural area and don’t have easy access to healthcare and family members. They still 
will not leave their family home. Studies show that when they do – particularly against their will – that move is often 
followed by cognitive and physical decline and death”.</p>

<p>Smart-homes are purpose designed living spaces that provide interactive technologies and unobtrusive support systems to 
enable people to enjoy a higher level of independence, activity,  participation or well-being than would otherwise be 
available. With these home based technologies there is potential for a person to live in 
their own home without the need to be hospitalised or institutionalised. Empowering the elderly to live 
independently instead of in an adult care facility not only provides financial savings, it also has the 
potential to improve quality of life, reduce the strain on aged care facilities, and provide relief for family caregivers.</p>

<p>However, we need a more viable and scalable solution to meet this demand. Enter a new wave of smart home technology known as 
“assistive domotics”.</p>

<p>Assistive domotics is an application of home automation that focuses on enabling elderly or disabled people to live at 
their home instead of a nursing home or similar healthcare facility. These products use sensors (eg: Bluetooth) to track 
movements in the home, or lack thereof, of the relevant resident. Sensors can be placed on any item, including doors, 
keychains, and even pillboxes. GPS technology documents precise location information of the person, logs activity, and 
reports it to a family member living somewhere else. Haven aims to harness all these available features and more. 
By using assistive domotics, some of the principal benefits Haven could provide to help independent living for the 
elderly are:
<ul>
<li>Emergency Response</li>
<li>Eyesight and hearing</li>
<li>Memory</ol>
<li>Video/Audio monitoring</li>
<li>Medication Assistance</li>
</ul></p>

<p>In addition to these immediate benefits to the resident, this type of technology provides support to those in the 
“sandwich generation,” a term coined for those simultaneously supporting aging parents and their children.</p>

					<p><strong>Haven </strong>is aimed at family, carers and medical professionals of the elderly or 
				disabled people who wish to live in their home safely and independently for as long as possible. <br>
				By utilising assistive domotics such as wearable tech and sensors, Haven will record an individual’s body 
				readings and track their activities inside and outside the house.<br> The carers will be able to unobtrusively 
				follow a person’s daily routine by reading simple time line charts accessible via website or downloadable 
				applications for tablets and smartphones. <br>Currently we believe there is a lack of appropriate applications
				for tablets, smartphones and systems which avail of smart home technology to 
				monitor and care for the vulnerable who wish to remain in their home.

				<p id = "research">Online of User Surveys<br>
Haven is centered around vulnerable residents but is aimed at the care support system (family members, carers and medical 
professionals).<br> Therefore online surveys and interviews where devised to focus on these two groups: Residents and Carers.<br>
<img src="img/survey charts/Survey carer age.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Survey carer age pie chart"> 
<img src="img/survey charts/Survey carer types.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Survey carer age pie chart">
Majority of surveyed carers are between 18-24 (22.2%) and 35-44 years old (27.8%).<br> Over half of them where family members 
(61.1%). Most of them ( 55.6%) are in contact with residents on a daily if not hourly basis.<br> The most common type of care 
provided was of personal assistance - getting out of bed, bathing, using the toilet, dressing, walking or eating (72.2%) 
and Dementia / Alzheimer's Care (44.4%).</p>
 <img src="img/survey charts/Survey features rank.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Survey carer age pie chart">


<p>When asked to choose the most important of Haven’s core functions, the highest scoring  was Alarms & Notifications, 
followed closely by Vital body readings (eg. blood pressure, sugar level), the Calendar, which is shared by carers, 
family, medical staff and the Care Network.<br> The only function that was deemed less important was Activity charts 
(eg. shows activity and indicates movement around various areas of the house). None were voted unimportant.</p>

<ul>
<li>Name: Margaret Gallagher </li>
<li>Age: 57</li>
<li>Education: Degree in Business Studies</Li>
<li>Occupation: Finance Manager</li>
<li>Interests: Cooking, TV dramas and fundraising</li> 
</ul>

<p>Personal details:<br>
Margaret is a single mother with two adult children who live a few time zones away.<br> 
She lives a short distance from her elderly father’s home. She is also working as a Finance Manager in a local company, 
but she still takes flexi time to check on her father, Anthony, and to prepare his meals. <br>
She is quite busy at work and is not yet eligible for an early retirement. <br>
A home help person is employed to visit three times a week to do some housework for her father. </p>

<p>Anthony has been widowed for nearly 2 years during which time it has been difficult for  him to cope. <br>
Recently he has started wandering late at night and just last month he nearly got knocked down by a car. <br>
He is quite deaf, so didn’t hear the car coming. This clearly distressed Margaret and she is looking for some form of 
security system through which she can keep an eye on her dad in the evenings.</p>

<p>Skills:<br>
Margaret has a Windows PC at work, and has a Windows-based laptop for the past few years.<br> She’s thinking of upgrading to a 
bigger smartphone as she finds it difficult to work with small touchscreens.<br> Being a finance manager she is accustomed to 
working with numbers and spreadsheets - she is meticulous and a firm believer in doing things “by the book”.</p>

<p>Goals:<br>
Keeping track of her father’s well being and location in the evenings. Having a call service to fall back on when she or 
the home help are not around in case of emergencies.</P>

<p>Where will Margret use Haven:
Anytime she looks on her phone she will see if there is a notification.<br> 
She will be able to check on Anthony wellness charts from work where she has internet access.</p>

<p>When will Margret use Haven:
She’ll be able to access the data 24/7.<br>
 Most frequently it will be among the first things on her phone to check, 
 and in the evening during her chat with her father.</p>



<p>What is Margaret’s attitude regarding Haven:<br>
Margaret has heard of Haven from her niece Jenny who works as a care assistant in a local daycare centre. <br>
Jenny mentioned that one of their regular visitors with dementia wears a smart bracelet that monitors his sugar and 
blood pressure. <br>It also helps the family to monitor their elderly relative in case he wanders off on his own.</p>

<p>Margaret looks up the service and books an appointment. The Haven agent brings a mini kit to demonstrate the working and 
principle behind the bracelet and other parts of the system.<br>
She understands that the camera and the microphone are activated by a call centre carer only when there is no notification 
confirmation from the list of client authorised first responders.<br> She has a couple of queries, namely whether 
the system would be secure and also does it require an internet connection in order to operate.</p>

<p>The agent explains that the sensor system within the house feeds the data to a router which doesn't need an internet 
connection to operate.<br> However in order to set up Haven and to be able to receive regular readings of daily activity 
charts, she would need WiFi or mobile internet on her own devices. <br>
The bracelet, she is told, has its own tracking device that doesn't require internet either.</p>

<p>Margaret decides to have a discussion with Anthony in order to see how he would  feel about it. Although at first, he is 
apprehensive about it, after a bit of explaining they decide to use the system for a two week trial.<br>
 Next month Margaret will be busy with quarterly revenue reports at work, 
 so she is keen to see if this system works for her father and herself.</p>

<p>Within the first week of the trial, Margaret pinpoints why her father tends to wake so often at night: he 
has problem with constipation which makes him feel unsettled.<br> He would go to the bathroom but then get disoriented in 
the dark and leave the house instead.<br> During this product trial, Margaret has connected her father's GP and the home 
help person to the Haven network, and all three of them now have a better insight of how well or unwell Anthony is feeling.</P>

<p>Margaret Now she is receiving notifications if her father is feeling restless; Anthony’s GP has recommended dietary 
adjustments via the network, based on Anthony’s toilet visits and the carer knows if he has had a meal or not.</p>

<p>On which device:<br>
Bracelet, android smartphone and laptop.</p>

<ul>					
<li>Name: Eva Clarke</li>
<li>Age: 52</li>
<li>Education: BSc in General Nursing</li>
<li>Occupation: District Nurse</li>
<li>Interests: Scout leading and carol singing</li>

</ul>
<p>Personal details:<br>
Eva is single and has no children. Working for the HSE as a district nurse keeps her busy.  
Her patients are spread out over a 15 km radius.<br> She visits 7-8 of them daily to ensure they are supported and assisted in 
changing bandages and administering injections and pumps.<br> Sometimes emotions can run high in households when the family 
members are experiencing difficulty coping with the changes to their loved ones.<br> 
Whilst leaving a patient Eva is often distressed as she knows that these families are not sufficiently familiar with 
emergency procedures that could help them cope. She is the first line of support for her at-home patients and has to 
constantly be alert when on call.</p><br>

Skills:<br>
Eva works on an old PC at the clinic, so her Office knowledge is not entirely up to date. She uses a smartphone regularly, 
as well as an e-reader which she finds handy for keeping up with her nursing courses.<br> A big fan of Facebook, 
she likes to keep in touch with her sisters who live in the United States. <br><br>

Goals:<br>
Quicker assessment of situation during emergency calls.<br> Ability to follow up on patients remotely and understanding the 
patient's needs better.<br><br>

What is Eva’s attitude regarding Haven:<br>
While visiting a neighbour - a Type 2 diabetes patient called Jim, she discovers he has developed a severe infection in 
one of his toes.<br> This happened due to Jim’s phobia of hospitals. Eva’s been contacted only after Jim’s grandson had 
found him on the floor trying to get up.<br> While looking after Jim, his grandson Mark approaches Eva inquiring about 
importance of body readings. <br>Intrigued Eva hears about Haven and agrees to participate in Jim and Mark’s trial of the 
system. She joins them on the day they have the agent over to configure the smart bracelet for Jim. <br>She is instructed on 
how to enter his baseline information, access the information from the Haven app on her smartphone and observe the changes 
in Jim’s vital signs; print out charts and share insights with family via the care network.<br><br> 

The trial takes two weeks.<br> Eva finds the system very helpful -  in fact helping her ascertain the time when Jim was having a 
particularly bad episode of tachycardia. He had complained about a lot of fatigue lately, so Eva set the alarm for extreme 
values of blood pressure specific to Jim.<br> A deviation occurred and she was immediately sent a notification from Haven 
while she was on her way to the clinic: Jim’s blood pressure was unusually low and his pulse rate was rather high.<br>
 She was able to return as soon as possible and help Jim avoid potential heart failure.<br><br>

After this incident, she has spoken to her colleagues and doctors at the clinic about Haven.<br> 
Some are considering offering the smart bracelets to their patients who would prefer to stay at home with remote 
monitoring which involves the carers and family. However, some colleagues believe this may increase their workload and 
build a patient's expectancy to have the medical staff available on call.<br><br>

Where will Margret use Haven:<br>
At work and off work in case of emergency notifications.<br><br>

When will Margret use Haven:<br>
During her work hours. She has agreed to keep an eye on Jim’s case and is receiving alert notifications for emergencies.<br><br>

On which device:<br>
On Eva’s Android smartphone

<p>It’s almost lunchtime and Margaret is at work. She has just finished her weekly financial meeting with management. <br>
She returns to her office and notices there are some notifications on her smartphone from the care system installed in her 
father’s home. It is informing her that there are spikes in his vitals reports.<br> This lets her know that her father is 
feeling unwell. <br>
Just then her phone rings and it’s an emergency call from the Haven system. <br>Because there was a delay in Margaret responding

When at work Margaret is a thirty minute drive to her father’s home so before making this journey she is able to log onto 
the care system on her phone and activate the cameras installed throughout his home in case of emergencies.<br> 
This will allow her to assess the situation and decide if she needs to call the emergency services. She is able to see her
